  - From specific position
  - By element (first occurrence)
  - By element (all occurrences)
- **Searching**
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search (Iterative & Recursive)
- **Sorting**
  - Built-in `Arrays.sort()`
  - Bubble Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Other Utilities**

## 🧠 Time Complexity

| Operation                 | Complexity |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Append (Add to end)       | **O(1)**   |
| Insert/Delete/Search      | **O(n)**   |
| Binary Search             | **O(log n)** |
| Bubble Sort               | **O(n²)**  |
| Quick Sort (Worst Case)   | **O(n²)**  |
| Quick Sort (Average Case) | **O(n log n)** |
